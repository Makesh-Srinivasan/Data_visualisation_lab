# Data visualisation lab (CSE3020 L55 + L56)
##### This is my repository for all my Data visualisation lab exercises.
##### The sub-folders are named in chronological order of the lab exercises
##### I have used R and Tableau throughout my lab exercises

##### I hope you enjoy my work just as much as I did learning more about R programming and Tableau
